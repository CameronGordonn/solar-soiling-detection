# Phase 1 diagnostic battery — Cameron runs this on his machine (has SAHI weights + torch).
# Writes everything to outputs/eval/sahi_baseline_train7/ and outputs/label_viz/.
#
# *** Reframed after 2026-05-04 finding ***: NAIP labels were drawn at 60cm
# source resolution, so small panels are systematically under-labeled. The
# "FP on alone tile" pattern is therefore most likely a *label gap*, not a
# model hallucination. These overlays double as a label-quality audit — every
# rendered confident_fp tile is a candidate for re-labeling.
#
# Order:
#   1. Bucket overlays — fast (each script re-runs inference on top-N tiles only,
#      not the whole split). ~1-2 min per bucket.
#   2. Threshold sweep — slow (~1-2 hours). Run after the overlays.
#
# After this finishes, Cameron triages the confident_fp overlays into:
#   (a) real label gaps → re-label before Josh trains R0
#   (b) genuine hallucinations (rare?) → note for post-retrain analysis
# Hard-negative augmentation is OFF the table — we'd be teaching the model to
# ignore real panels.
